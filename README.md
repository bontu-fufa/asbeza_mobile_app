### **Description**
The Asbeza app is used to track weekly, monthly, or any other duration <i>asbeza</i> (expense). An item can be added to a list if a user wishes to purchase it and ticked off if it has been bought. The app presents the user with the price range for common items where the price is set by the city administrator (admin). If a certain item is purchased out of the range set by the admin, the purchaser can make a report by entering the location where the item was purchased and some description. A report can be liked or upvoted by other users if they have encountered the same situation. If a report's like/upvote passes a certain threshold, it will be forwarded to the admin for review. The city administrator can then take actions if it deems the report valid.
